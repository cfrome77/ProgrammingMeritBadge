# Instructions

These are the sample programs I have written for use with requirement 5. The following programming languages are used:

1. Processing (processing.org)
2. HTML/Javascript (w3schools.com/html | w3schools.com/js)
3. Python (python.org)
4. Java (java.com/en/)

You are also welcome to choose a program other than what I have provided,
but will need to get my approval first befor you start working.

For each of the three programs you choose you will need to email me your modified code. You will need to do one of the following to let ne know the change(s)
you made:

1. Use code comments to document the changes you made either at the top of the program or directly obove where the change was made
2. Email a seperate typed docuement outlining the changes made

For all programs you should either name the file programName_yourName.extension or include your name as a comment at the top of the file

To get the specific details about each program look at the README.md file in folder for the specific language. It includes ideas for the changes you can make to each program
